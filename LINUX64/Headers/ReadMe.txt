This folder and its subfolders are for use by Applications (includs applications interface library Headers).
Actualy possible including only *.h / *.hpp files.

Possible (and because it compatabil) copied here (also) the Headers from location used for builds the Libraries.
Because of same Tree Structur possible copy the Src folders from location builds the Libraries.
But here no needs and possible delete the *.c / *.cpp files...
